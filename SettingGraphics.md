**It is not recommended using scale graphis.** <br>
If you set Scale Graphics, you need to preview pdf several times until you get the best scaling.<br>

<b>Using the Set Width (Column Width %) is the recommended one.</b><br>
What you have to do is just to set the percentage of the image will occupy the column page.<br>
The result will be accurate, you do not need to try several times.<br>
