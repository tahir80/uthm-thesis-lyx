## Printing result is not as expected, looks smaller ##

General mistake: <br>
Printing thesis directly from pdf preview.<br><br>

Why:<br>
The printview pdf is not for printing, only for viewing purpose. <br><br>

<h2>How to print</h2>

<h3>a. Create pdf file: File > Export > PDF (pdflatex)</h3>

<h3>b. Open the created pdf using your pdf reader</h3>
<br>

<h3>c. Setting the printer option</h3>
Make sure you have the following settings:<br>
<ul><li>Paper type : <b>A4</b> (The paper used for the thesis is A4, sometimes the default is letter)<br>
</li><li>Page Scaling : <b>None</b> (It is a common mistake to select "Fit to printable area", or "Shrink to printable area", or similar. Leave it at "None".)</li></ul>
